# SQL ADHOC Requests Data Analysis Resume Challenge 4 Project - Codebasics

Following attached are 10 .sql files in which I have executed Data Analysis using SQL Programming language for 10 requests provided by the Client **Codebasics**. Attached are all the 10 SQL Requests solution (.sql) files as well as the Presentation created in Power BI exported to (.pdf) and a requests file (.pdf) provided by the client Codebasics.

## Project Description
Domain: **Consumer Goods** | Function: **Executive Management**

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. Therefore they have provided the sql database file for Data Analysis to provide relevent insights for their top management, such that they can take calculated business decisions.

The client Provided a .sql (SQL text file) named (atliq_hardware_db), this file needs to be imported in **MySQL Workbench** software by going to MySQL Workbench, then in the toolbar ==> Server ==> Data Import.

This file provides a comprehensive overview of the tables found in the 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database. It includes information for six main tables:

1. dim_customer: contains customer-related data
2. dim_product: contains product-related data
3. fact_gross_price: contains gross price information for each product
4. fact_manufacturing_cost: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
5. fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
6. fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.


## Usage

**One requires following Softwares ready and installed for Data Analysis and creating Presentations**:-
1. MySQL Workbench for data analysis using SQL Programming.
2. PowerBI Desktop or Microsoft Powerpoint for creating presentations of generated insights.
3. Microsoft Excel for previewing or making changes in .csv files exported from MySQL workbench.
4. Adobe Acrobat for pdf output.
